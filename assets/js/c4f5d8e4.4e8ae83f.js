In 2022, while I was learning PHP and hosting projects on Replit, I needed a free, flexible database solution. I began by storing data as plain HTML, which later evolved into using JSON for structured storage. However, I soon discovered that public exposure on Replit revealed sensitive data, creating vulnerabilities that I couldn\'t ignore.\n    <br/><br/>\n    Determined to build something safer and more reliable, I transformed my idea into a full-fledged package in late 2022, adding OpenSSL encryption to protect the data. By December 2022, I published the first version on GitHub as JSDB, laying the foundation with essential functions.\n    <br/><br/>\n    In March 2023, persistent issues with converting data between encrypted and unencrypted states pushed me to innovate further\u2014introducing functions like <code>encall</code> and <code>decall</code> and releasing version 2. Throughout 2023, I continued refining my database, adding critical features such as <code>array_intersect_recursive</code>, which allows for powerful, recursive data operations.\n    <br/><br/>\n    By 2024, it had become an integral part of my workflow, I renamed it to JasperDB from JSDB due to an existing database called JSDB. For a time while I dedicated myself to developing frameworks like <a href="https://phlame.oryvex.in" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phlame API</a> and <a href="https://github.com/KanishRavikumar-2005/ootPHP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ootPHP Framework</a> I still continued to use my database in many of my projects.\n    <br/><br/>\n    Early in 2025, I enhanced the database with improved filtering and search capabilities. Finally, in March 2025, I published this refined version on GitHub\u2014naming it SwartzDB in tribute to Aaron Swartz, whose legacy of open access and innovation continues to inspire me every day.\n  ':"SwartzDB is more than just a tool\u2014it's a piece of my heart.
